  "description": "A tool for performing static analysis against code.\nThis tool can validate that code conforms to best practices, check for security vulnerabilities, and identify possible\nperformance issues. It returns a JSON containing the absolute path to a results file if such a file was created,\nand a string indicating the overall success or failure of the operation.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- When the user asks you to generate files, use this tool to scan those files.\n- When the user asks you to check code for problems, use this tool to do that.\n\nOptional: Provide a \"selector\" (same semantics as \"list_code_analyzer_rules\") to choose which rules to run.\nExamples:\n- \"Security:pmd\" → run Security-tagged PMD rules\n- \"Critical\" → run all Critical-severity rules\n- \"(Security,Performance):eslint\" → ESLint rules tagged Security or Performance\n\nAfter completion: Use the \"query_code_analyzer_results\" tool to filter and explain results, e.g., top-N most severe violations or violations by category/tag.",
