  "description": "A tool for selecting Code Analyzer rules based on a number of criteria.\nThis tool returns a JSON array describing Code Analyzer rules that match a \"selector\".\nA selector is a colon-separated (:) string of tokens; tags and severity names are case-insensitive.\nYou can OR multiple tokens of the same type by grouping them in parentheses and separating with commas, e.g. \"(Performance,Security)\".\n\nPolicy: To prevent overly broad results, the full unfiltered list of rules is not returned unless you explicitly set allowFullList=true.\nThis flag defaults to false and its use is not recommended.\nNote: Listing large rule sets can significantly increase token consumption.\n\nExamples:\n- \"Recommended\" → all rules tagged as Recommended.\n- \"Performance:pmd:Critical\" → rules in the PMD engine with the Performance tag and Critical severity.\n- \"pmd:(Performance,Security):2\" → PMD rules with Performance OR Security tags and severity 2.\n- \"(Apex,JavaScript):Recommended\" → rules for Apex OR JavaScript languages that are Recommended.\n- \"Security:High\" → rules tagged Security with High severity.\n- \"Apex:Recommended\" → rules for the Apex language that are Recommended.\n- \"DevPreview\" → rules marked as DevPreview.\n- Prompt: \"tell me about all performance rules\" → selector: \"Performance\".\n\nSupported selector tokens:\n- Engines: eslint, regex, retire-js, flow, pmd, cpd, sfge\n- Severities (names): Critical, High, Moderate, Low, Info\n- Severities (numbers): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n- General tags: Recommended, Custom, All\n- Categories: BestPractices, CodeStyle, Design, Documentation, ErrorProne, Security, Performance\n- Languages: Apex, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, Visualforce, XML\n- Engine-specific tags: DevPreview, LWC\n\nTip: Use the \"describe_code_analyzer_rule\" tool to get details for any listed rule.\n",
